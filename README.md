Welcome to synonymyzer, it's a web app that convert an input text into another one, replacing each word with a synonym. It's my first React app, excuse me if it's filled with spaghetti code

## Prerequisites
You need Node.js

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit src/App.jsx: replace YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE (line 3) with a valid API key for [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Open the link sent in the terminal in a web browser
6. Have fun !
